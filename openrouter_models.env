# Model Characteristics:
#
# openai/gpt-4o - Premium OpenAI model, excellent for technical and general tasks
# anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 - Excellent reasoning, good for legal/therapy
# google/gemini-pro-1.5 - Google's flagship, good multimodal capabilities
# meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct - Open source, good performance/cost ratio
# qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct - Excellent coding capabilities
# cohere/command-r-plus - Good for RAG and legal analysis
